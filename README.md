# Typedancing
This was a beginner training project. I wanted to learn something about JS, CSS and HTML, so I came up with a very simple, fast and fun idea: making the rainbow parrot-gif dance when someone types in the text input-field. A function listenes to the key input and executes when certain keys are pressed. On execution, the rainbow parrot-gif does one loop.

Looking at the project now, I still think it's such a fun and nice idea to learn a little bit about JS, CSS and HTML but I would certainly write a more elegant way of executing the gif loops.
